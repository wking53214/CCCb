"""Recurrence detection: is a new observation a fresh, independent
occurrence of a pattern already on record -- even when the specific
evidence is different?

This is the piece CCC's discovery.py (anomaly -> pattern -> mandate) never
had. discovery.py has the escalation machine; it had no way to notice that
observation #2 is the same underlying thing as observation #1 unless a
human said so. Without that, a stream of findings either stays a pile of
disconnected ANOMALYs or gets miscounted -- the anti-probability duplicate
check (ccc.matching) catches "literally the same content re-observed," but
that is the opposite signal: a re-observation is NOT an independent
occurrence and must not advance a pattern. Recurrence is the other case --
different content, same shape -- and it is what a 2nd occurrence means.

The method here is lexical, not semantic. A recurrence is recognized when
two observations share enough of their significant vocabulary (Jaccard
over concept sets). It will catch "the terminology inflated again" against
"vocabulary inflation recurred"; it will NOT catch the same idea phrased
with no shared words. That is a real limit, stated plainly: a semantic
version needs an embedding layer (Ecology has one), and this stays
deterministic, explainable, and dependency-free to match discovery.py's
own discipline about not guessing.

APM (William's own framework, and discovery.py's state machine):
1st occurrence = ANOMALY, 2nd = PATTERN (machine may advance -- pattern is
"investigate," not "act"), 3rd = MANDATE candidate (human establishment
only, never advanced here).


Moved here from CCC
-------------------
This module was ``ccc/recurrence.py`` in wking53214/CCC up to commit d039efd. It
moved to CCCb when CCC was narrowed to one job: CCC keeps the rules about what
a match *means* (a re-observation never counts as a new occurrence, a machine
may raise an anomaly to a pattern but never to a mandate). CCCb keeps the
measurement of how alike two texts are. References below to discovery.py,
record_external_finding and the APM ladder describe how CCC uses this module;
CCCb itself imports nothing from CCC.
