"""Anti-probability matching: is this content overlap implausible as
coincidence, rather than "does this look similar."

The distinction, stated plainly: this never proves either side is genuine.
Two forged findings can match each other perfectly and this will say so
with total confidence -- consistency between two items is not evidence
either one is true. What it *can* honestly answer is a narrower question:
given how much information is actually in the matching text, how implausible
is it that two independent, honest processes produced that overlap by
accident? A short common phrase matching is unremarkable. A long, specific,
idiosyncratic match is not something two unrelated processes produce by
chance -- which licenses treating the two as the same thing observed twice,
never that the thing itself is real.

The math: Shannon's 1951 estimate of English text entropy is roughly
1.0-1.5 bits per character (published, not invented here). Modeling a
chance character-for-character match at that rate, the probability that an
L-character exact overlap arose by coincidence between two independent
texts is roughly 2^(-H*L). That number gets astronomically small fast --
which is the point: a short coincidental match is plausible, a long one
is not.

## History: this module was rewritten once, adversarially, against itself

The first version used difflib's SequenceMatcher for a single longest-match.
It had three confirmed, live exploits before this rewrite:

1. Boilerplate-decoy evasion: since only the single longest match was ever
   returned, appending known boilerplate (longer than a real duplicate
   payload) to a finding made the boilerplate "win" the match slot, get
   correctly excluded as boilerplate, and silently hide the real duplicate
   sitting right next to it. Confirmed: a 139-char genuine duplicate,
   camouflaged by a 900-char license, was never even considered.
2. Truncation-padding evasion: MAX_COMPARISON_LENGTH truncated to a fixed
   prefix. Padding ~2100 characters of anything in front of real duplicate
   content pushed it entirely out of the compared window. Confirmed:
   match_length=0 for a text pair sharing 139 real characters of duplicate
   content.
3. Unicode homoglyph evasion: no normalization at all. Swapping five Latin
   characters for visually-identical Cyrillic lookalikes throughout an
   otherwise word-for-word identical string dropped the match from the
   full string length to match_length=11.

This version replaces the single-longest-match algorithm with exhaustive
shingle-based matching (every position, not sampled) specifically because
sampling introduces a real, separate recall risk: two independent texts'
shingle grids can be out of phase with each other near the boundary of a
short match. Exhaustive (stride 1) extraction has no such gap -- any shared
substring of at least SHINGLE_LENGTH characters is guaranteed to produce at
least one matching shingle in both texts, independent of position. This is
the same reasoning that ruled out a sampled/strided global index earlier in
this project; it's used here because the risk it was rejected for doesn't
apply at stride 1.


Moved here from CCC
-------------------
This module was ``ccc/matching.py`` in wking53214/CCC up to commit d039efd. It
moved to CCCb when CCC was narrowed to one job: CCC keeps the rules about what
a match *means* (a re-observation never counts as a new occurrence, a machine
may raise an anomaly to a pattern but never to a mandate). CCCb keeps the
measurement of how alike two texts are. References below to discovery.py,
record_external_finding and the APM ladder describe how CCC uses this module;
CCCb itself imports nothing from CCC.
